## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to look at temperature trends on the island of Oahu. These trends will hopefully enlighten us as to whether or not an ice cream shop can sustain business year round, as it was shown that the higher the tempurature is the more ice cream one will sell. We decide to look at data from the months of June and December as the more extreme months will paint a better picture.

## Results

Our findings display these details for June:

Using our results, we can draw these conclusions:

- The mean temperature in December is roughly three degrees lower than the mean temperature in June.
- The max temperature in December is only two degrees lower than the max temperature in June.
- The min temperature in December is a whopping eight degrees lower than the min temperature in June.
