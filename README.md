## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to look at temperature trends on the island of Oahu. These trends will hopefully enlighten us as to whether or not an ice cream shop can sustain business year round, as it was shown that the higher the tempurature is the more ice cream one will sell. We decide to look at data from the months of June and December as the more extreme months will paint a better picture.
